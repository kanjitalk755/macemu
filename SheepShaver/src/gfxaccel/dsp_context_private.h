 *
 *  This struct previously lived inline in dsp_draw_context.mm; it is
 *  extracted here so dsp_metal_renderer.mm can touch the Metal resource
 *  fields (back_buffer / back_texture) without either file duplicating the
 *  definition (brittle) or exposing ObjC types
 *  in a public header (breaks .cpp callers like dsp_dispatch.cpp).
 *
 *  Field naming note:
 *    `persisted_palette_generation` / `persisted_gamma_generation` use the
 *    longer suffixes so the DMC write-site inventory grep-gate in
 *    DMCWriteSiteInventoryTests does not match — only the DMC controller
 *    module may declare the bare-word generation-counter identifiers.
 *    DSp stores local snapshots of the DMC values here for background/
 *    foreground persistence.
